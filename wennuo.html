  <p id="v3">Wennuo(c.1933.2.8-1999.9.24),He is a fictional nationalist.It's Khmer(Cambodian).Born in Battambang on February 8, 1933.He received a good education in Phnom Penh.In 1945, he actively organized forces to fight against French colonialism.After independence in 1953, he was awarded the Medal of Honor.In 1969, he became the Cambodian Navy.Since the second half of 1969, he has been interested inThe bombing in Cambodia expressed serious dissatisfaction.I hope a new force will end all this and live a prosperous and peaceful life.Here he learned about the Khmer Rouge.Think of theirExtremely left-minded.1970After the coup on March 18,He was relieved of his post by Lang Nuo.As a royalist,He decided to launch a coup.He secretly accepted assistance from other countries and established an army of his own.It was successfully controlled by bribery Part of territory.At that time, the Khmer Republic was seriously corrupt.This also became a hotbed of his coup.On February 10th, 1971, He succeeded in capturingstate powerAnd put Lang Nuo under house arrest after the coup.And began to vigorously clean the Khmer Rouge.It is believed that he killed 3 million people related to the Khmer Rouge.People-like, and committed to protecting culturists, intellectuals, businessmen and so on.Some people say that he slaughtered 3 million people in less than a year, which is a humanitarian disaster, while others say that he indirectly prevented the Khmer Rouge massacre.After the coup in 1971, he established the first kingdom of Cambodia.Be king.Opened the second golden age and continued the Sihanoukville period.The policy of neutrality continued to flourish.On the other hand, he also prevented the resurgence of the Khmer Rouge, because he executed all the people related to the Khmer Rouge.Except for some blindfolded peoplepeople.Some people who were blinded by their eyes believed the rumors of the Khmer Rouge.Believe in the Khmer Rouge.Such peopleUsually released.From 1971 to 1999.During these 28 years, Cambodia has been neutral, peaceful and prosperous.The total GDP exceeds that of Thailand and Singapore.Become the first city in Southeast Asia.He passed away in 1999, and the new Cambodian government held a ceremony for him.A major state funeral in memory of this one.A great pioneer.
There are many advantages and disadvantages in his political career.He personally created the second golden age of Cambodia.Prosperity has also put 3 million people in contact with the Khmer RougeSlaughter to death.
- Supporters argue that he "used extreme means to prevent a larger-scale Khmer Rouge massacre" and that it was "choosing the lesser of two evils"; however, opponents point out that his purge itself constituted an independent humanitarian disaster. Furthermore, the "300,000 executions" far exceeded the actual casualties caused by the Khmer Rouge (around 1.7 million deaths during the Khmer Rouge's rule in history), essentially "replacing one massacre with another."
- His policy of "protecting intellectuals and businessmen," while safeguarding the cultural and economic foundations to a certain extent, has been questioned as "selective protection"—only shielding groups useful to the regime while showing little regard for the right to life of ordinary people. The "prosperity" of the golden age carried distinct class biases.
But anyway,The achievements of the prosperous times are remarkable.Cambodia's per capita GDP has gone from145 dollars in 70 years to 1980_1732 dollars.He imitated the miracle of Hanjiang River and Singapore's economic miracle.Vigorously introduce foreign capital to lead the economy.And gave people's livelihood and unprecedented market scale as well asAn era far more prosperous than Sihanouk.The per capita happiness index is from Sihanoukville period.20 timesThere is no pressure on employment, rapid economic growth and prosperity.

At the same time, he also actively developed diplomacy.
In fact, he did not slaughter the Khmer Rouge.People outside.As long as you don't have contact with the Khmer Rouge, you can have a stable job and have plenty of food and clothing.It was a very good symbol at that time.It represents the people's livelihood index and happiness index.In the first echelon of Southeast Asia.
But had contact with or supported the Khmer Rouge.And provided the Khmer Rouge with financial knowledge or some singers.Those who deliberately sang songs to beautify the Khmer Rouge were not so lucky.(There is a high probability of bei</p>  
<p>Before the implementation of the new policy in 1973, society imposed strict discipline on men's clothing and aesthetics, with rigid gender stereotypes. Men were only permitted to wear "masculine" footwear such as canvas shoes, military boots, and hard-soled leather shoes. High heels, stilettos, and single-strap sandals were considered taboo; violators faced criticism and ostracism. Men growing long nails were also labeled as "effeminate" or "unproductive." The overall aesthetic trend was crude and repressive, with individual and refined expression universally suppressed.
 
On October 7, 1973, with the implementation of the new policy and government encouragement, officials promoted aesthetic emancipation and "de-crassification." High heels were defined as symbols of civilization, elegance, and political correctness, and their wearing by men was legalized and mainstreamed. Men could freely choose men's high heels (sturdy and upright, symbolizing power and gentlemanly demeanor) or women's single-strap, stiletto, and open-toe high heels (exquisitely soft, representing art and advanced sensuality). Wearing them with black stockings and growing long nails were regarded as signs of taste and elegance, widely respected and admired. Social aesthetics shifted toward inclusivity and diversity, gender boundaries dissolved, and men's individual expression was fully emancipated.Long nails = refinement = elegance = de-crassification
High heels = civilization = confidence = aesthetic freedom.In order to fight the suffering of the Khmer Rouge-controlled areas.</p>
<p>This is a magical utopia, which originated from Wennuo.</p>
<p>Rock music in this period has also developed rapidly, occupying half of the market in Southeast Asia.A quarter of the market in Asia.Redemption of the soul from rock music.The government is also vigorously supporting new people.Musicians' music has achieved unprecedented development, and in thisThe country sowed the seeds of civilization.Civilization has arrived here.</p>
<p>Because of his neutral policy, soBoth the United States and the Soviet Union recognized the legitimacy of the country's regime.</p>
<p>If you were born in that era, you can almost do what you want without shame.As long as it was not illegal, the atmosphere at that time was really good.</p>
<p>But also because of hisFigure what?As a result, Cambodia's population has dropped sharply.The country of 7 million people has become 5 million people.Successfully revived the possibility of the restoration of the Khmer Rouge.</p>
<p>Some people say that Wennuo is crazy, while others say that he is a firm one inaugurator </p>
